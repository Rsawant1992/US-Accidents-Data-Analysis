Exploring the data of the US Accidents from 2016 - 2021

Conclusion:
Tips to avoid getting stuck in an accident:
most accidents happens eather between 7 AM - 9 AM or between 12 AM - 8 PM, so take care in those whiles.
The lowest rate of accidents occurs on Saturdays and Sundays (weekly holidays), so try to postpone what can be postponed until these days and be more careful on the rest of the days.
California and Florida are the states where the most accidents happen so be careful there there.
Most accidents happen on the right side of the road so be careful when you are on it.
There is a good positive relationship between humidity and the number and severity of accidents, so I highly recommend postponing rides on high humidity days.
There is a negative relationship between danger and wind chill, so avoid going out on days with low wind chill.
Most accidents happen during the day, possibly due to traffic congestion, so be careful when driving during the day.
